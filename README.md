# Extend Python with the Power and Safety of Rust

Join us for an in-depth webinar exploring the powerful synergy between Python and Rust. Python's versatility meets Rust's performance and safety in the realm of creating Python extensions. Whether you're a Python developer looking to optimize critical sections of your codebase or a Rust aficionado keen to integrate with Python ecosystems, this session is for you.

# Getting Started

To code with the instructor, create a fork of this repository, then create a GitHub Codespace on the fork. The `Fork` button is in the upper-right-hand corner of this page. Once forked, create the green `Code` button on your forked version to access the ability to create a Codespace.

GitHub provides a generous amount of free time for Codespaces each month (currently, 120 hours). You are responsible for any charges incurred if you exceed the free time. You can monitor your usage in the GitHub settings.

**IMPORTANT:** Because of the limited time for the course, if you run into setup problems, it will not be possible to provide individual support. If you have trouble setting up a local environment, we recommend using Codespaces. If you cannot set up a programming environment, please watch the class, and you can code along with the class recording later.
